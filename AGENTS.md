## [2025-09-19] - OT Slips Date Timezone Fix

### Fixed
- **Issue**: OT Slips were showing dates one day earlier than the actual scheduled shift (e.g., 9/16/2025 showing as 9/15/2025)
- **Root Cause**: Timezone handling issue when parsing dates from Firebase. JavaScript's `Date` constructor was interpreting date strings as UTC midnight, causing timezone shifts
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated date parsing logic to properly handle both ISO format dates and regular date strings
  - Added `parseLocalDate()` helper function to correctly parse "YYYY-MM-DD" strings into local Date objects
  - Updated date display in both the frontend shift list and PDF generation

### Changes Made
- Modified `app/dashboard/ot-slips/page.tsx`:
  - Enhanced date parsing in `fetchWorkedShiftsForMonth` function (lines 83-95)
  - Added `parseLocalDate` helper function (lines 415-420)
  - Updated date display in shift list (line 576)
  - Updated date display in PDF generation (line 296)

### Impact
- Officers will now see the correct date for their scheduled shifts on both the OT Slips page and generated PDFs
- No more confusion about shift dates being off by one day
